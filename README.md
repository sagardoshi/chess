Welcome to my chess game! I completed this game for a project in my course in MSc Computing Science at Imperial College London.

To see a full game played, simply follow these instructions:
1) Download or clone this repository
2) When in this (the root) directory, type 'make' into the command line to create the program
3) Once that is complete, type 'make run' to see the game in action

To make any edits or change the way the game is played yourself, navigate to the ChessMain.cpp file in the src directory. There, you can add or remove whatever moves you would like using the submitMove() function, which uses file and rank strings, as in professional games of chess.

If you run into any trouble, or if there's a bug, please contact me or issue a bug request. Thanks very much.
